# Rotational Statics

## 1. Torque due to Gravity

> $$ \tau = R_{CM} Mg sin{\theta} = \vec{R_{CM}} \times M \vec{g} $$

## 2. Statics Example: Beam and Wire

Newton's 2nd Law:
> $$ F_{H,x} - Tcos{\theta} = 0 $$
>
> $$ F_{H,y} + Tsin{\theta} - Mg = 0 $$
Newton's 2nd Law for Rotations (Apply at the hinge)
> $$ TLsin{\theta} - Mg \frac{L}{2} = 0 $$
> Which means:
> $$ T = \frac{Mg}{2sin{\theta}} $$
So as a conclusion:
> $$ F_{H,x} = \frac{Mg}{2tan{\theta}} $$
>
>$$ F_{H,y} = \frac{Mg}{2} $$

## Also, we can change the angle of the beam
