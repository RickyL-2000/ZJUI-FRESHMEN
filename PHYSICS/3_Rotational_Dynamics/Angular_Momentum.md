# Angular Momentum

## Conservation of Angular Momentum

When the external torque acting on the system is zero, then the total angular momentum, $L$ will be conserved.

> $$ \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p} $$
> $$ \vec{L} = \vec{\tau} \times t $$
> $$ L = I \omega $$

## Angular Momentum and Kinetic Energy

> $$ K = \frac{L^2}{2 I} $$
> $$ K_f = \frac{I_i}{I_f} K_i $$

## Example

### 1. Point Particle Moving in a Circle

The angular momentum can be added as a system

> $$ L_{Total} = I_{Total} \omega $$

*Pay attention to the direction of the angular momentum* !

### 2. Solid Objects

Transfer the sum to the integral

> $$ \vec{L} = (\int dmr^2)\vec{\omega} = I \vec{\omega} $$
> *Earth's Total Angular Momentum*
> $$ \vec{L_{Total}} = \vec{L_{CM}} + \vec{L}^* $$

#### **NOTICE!!!**

For the earth model, if the direction of the angular momentum of the center of mass and about an axis through its center is different, the total angular momentum should be the **vector sum**!!!

### 3. Disk Dropped on Disk

Because there is no external torque, the total angular momentum is conserved.

> It's like a totally inelastic collision translatively.

### 4. Point Particle Moving in a Straight Line

### 5. Jumping on a stationary Merry-go-Round Example

> $$ \vec{L_{initial}} = \vec{L_{final}} $$
> $$ m_{you} v_0 R = I_{Total} \omega = (I_{merry-go-round} + I_{you}) \omega $$

## Precession 进动与岁差

If the external torque exerted on the spinning disk is vertical to the angular momentum (like exerting on the axis), the angular momentum respect to the axis is unchanged.

> $$ \frac{\tau_{Net,External}}{L} = \Omega $$

## Gyroscope

> $$ \Omega = \frac{\tau_{Weight}}{L} = \frac{2gd}{R^2 \omega} $$
