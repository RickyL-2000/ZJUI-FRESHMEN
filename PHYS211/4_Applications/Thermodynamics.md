# Introduction To Thermodynamics

## Change in Internal Energy

> $$ \Delta E_{Internal} = W_{Net on the System} - \Delta K_{CM} $$

## First Law of Thermodynamics

> $$ W_{Net} = \Delta E_{Mechanical,CM} + \Delta E_{Internal} $$

We use the simbol $U$ to represent the $E_{Internal}$

Therefore, by the **First Law of Thermodynamics**: 

> $$ \Delta U = W_{Net} + Q $$

## Irreversible Process

The Big Idea: Irreversibility is explained by having energy flow so that at equilibrium, the number of states available to the system is a maximum. 

## The Second Law of Thermodynamics

> $$ \Delta S \geqslant 0 $$ 
> for an isolated system

Entropy:
> $$ S \propto \ln(N_{states})

### Volume Exchange Example

> $$ \Omega_{IndividualMolecule} \propto V $$
