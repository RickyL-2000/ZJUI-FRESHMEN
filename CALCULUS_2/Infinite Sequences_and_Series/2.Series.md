# Series

## Definition 1

> Lett $n$th denote a partial sum $S_n = \Sigma a_i$. If the sequence {$S_n$} is convergent and $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty]} S_n = s$ exists as a real number, then the series $\Sigma a_n$ is called convergent.
>
> If the sequence {$S_n$} is divergent, then the series is called divergent.

## Geometric Series

there is a common ratio $r$

Also there is a formula for the sum of the geometric series

## Harmonic Series

> $$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}+...

It is divergent.

## Theorem 1

If the series $\Sigma a_n$ is convergent, then $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = 0$

## Power Series

center

only has three possiblities of convergence

R, the radius of convergence; the interval of convergence

Notice!! For the **endpoints** of a convergence interval, they should be discussed individually!!!
