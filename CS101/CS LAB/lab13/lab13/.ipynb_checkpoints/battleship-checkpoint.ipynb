    "The [classic guessing game _Battleship_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29) arose as a two-player pen-and-paper game during World War I.  Each player has a (hidden) grid upon which he or she plots several ships, as well as a blank grid on which to plot his or her shots at the enemy ships (and guesses).  The players then take turns guessing grid coördinates as shots to destroy each other's fleet.\n",
