# Sequences

## Definition 1

> A sequence $[a_n]$ has the limit $L$ and we write
> > $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}a_n = L
> or
> > $a_n \rightarrow L$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$
> Then the sequence converges.

## Definition 2

>A sequence has the limit $L$ and ...

## Definition 3

>If the limit of $f(x) = L$ and $f(n) = a_n$ when $n$ is an integer, then the limit of $a_n = L$.

## Definitio 4

about the limit of $a_n = \infty$.

## Theorem 1

> If the limit of $|a_n| = 0$, then the limit of $a_n = 0$

## Theorem 2

> If $\lim_{n \Rightarrow \infty} a_n = L$ and the function $f$ is continuous at $L$, then $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(a_n) = f(L)$

## The sequence $r^n$ : compare -1, $r$, and 1

## Definition 5

> The inceasing and decreasing sequences.

## Definition 6

> The bounded sequence.

## Monotonic Sequence Theorem

> Every bounded, monotonic sequence is convergent.
