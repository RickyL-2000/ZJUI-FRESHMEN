# Taylor and Maclaurin Series

## The coefficient

> $$ c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} $$

## The Taylor Series

> $$ f(x) = \Sigma^\infty_{n=0} \frac{f^{(n)} (a)}{n!}(x - a)^n

## The Maclaurin Series

> Just the Taylor Series when $a=0$.

### Theorem

If $f(x) = T_n(x) + R_n(x)$, and the limit of the **remainder** is 0, then $f$ is equal to the sum of its Taylor series on the interval $|x-z| < R$

### Taylor's Inequality

**Notice:**
When deriving the Taylor series of a function, don't forget to check if the series is **convergent** or not.

### The Main Steps to find the Taylor Series

1. Find the derivative and learn the pattern.
2. Plug in the $a$.
3. Set up the series.
4. Find the interval of convergence. the **Ratio Test**
5. Check the endpoints.

**Notice!!!** Check twice this part!! You are weak on this part. Especially the $a$.

### The Main Steps to find the Maclaurin Series

1. Fin the derivative.
2. Plug in $0$.
3.
